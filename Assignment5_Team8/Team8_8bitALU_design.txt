Design for 8 bit ALU

ALU8 chip has -
3 buses of 8 bits : 2 for input and 1 for output
1 bus of 3 bits : for opcode
1 bit for U'/S : input bit for signed (signed)
1 bit flag for overflow (of)
1 bit flag for equality (eq)

Opcodes stand respectively for :
000 No Operation (NOP)
001 And Operation
010 Or Operation
011 Xor Operation
100 Signed/Unsigned Addition 
101 Signed/Unsigned Subtraction
110 Unsigned Inteerger multiplication (UMUL)
111 Signed Integer multiplication (IMUL)

__________________________________________________________________________

For NOP, code simply outputs all zeroes
For And, code uses And8.hdl chip
For Or, code uses Or8.hdl chip
For Xor, code uses Xor8.hdl chip
For Addition, code uses Adder8.hdl chip with oper bit set to 0
For Subtracion, code uses Adder8.hd chip with oper bit set to 1
For UMUL, code uses UnsignedIntergerMultiplier8.hdl
For IMUL, code uses SignedIntegerMultiplier8.hdl

first four opcodes (msb is 0) are logical operations
next four (msb = 1) are arithmetic operations

code uses 2 8bit 4 to 1 multiplexers to determine which of the arithemetic and logical output is to be outputed.
Then an 8 bit 2 to 1 multiplexer determines which of the two units is to be outputed.

similarly, the code uses 2 1 bit 4 to 1 multiplexers in similar fashion for each of the overflow bits
then a 1 bit 2 to 1 multiplexer for the final overflow bit
