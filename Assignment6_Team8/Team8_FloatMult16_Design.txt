DESIGN FOR FLOAT MULTIPLIER 16 HDL CHIP : FloatMultiplier16.HDL

16 bit Floating point number : bit 15 is sign bit, bits 14 to 7 are exponent bits, bits 6 to 0 are mantissa bits
NOTE : This representation is exclusive of all special cases that are otherwise included in IEEE standard. 
Exponent bias value : 127

VALID ARGUMENT DETECTION INVOLVES :
1. EXPONENT BITS SHOULD NEITHER BE ALL ZEROES NOR ALL ONES, BOTH FOR INPUTS AND OUTPUTS
2. DURING ADDITION OF EXPONENTS , RESULT IS EXPECTED AS 9 BITS. HOWEVER AFTER SUBTRACTING BIAS VALUE, BIT8 (MSB) SHOULD BECOME ZEROES
IF ANYONE OF THESE CONDITIONS IN VIOLATED, VALID BIT IS RESET TO ZERO. OTHERWISE ALL IS FINE AND VALID BIT IS SET

SIGN OF PRODUCTS : CALCULATED DIRECTLY FROM THE SIGNS OF ARGYMENTS. BASED ON PRINCIPLE THAT LIKE SIGNS YIELD SIGN 0; AND 1 OTHERWISE

MANTISSA OF PRODUCTS : 
    1.M FORM (M IS 7 BIT MANTISSA) IS USED IN UMUL8 TO YIELD 16 BIT PRODUCT FORM (mantissa[16])
    
EXPONENT OF PRODUCTS :
    8 BIT EXPONENTS ARE ADDED TO GIVE 9 BIT NUMBER. THEN 127 OR 126 IS SUBTRACTED (BASED ON WHETHER MSB OF MANTISSA IS 0 OR 1).

FINALLY, NUMBER IS PACKED AND OUTPUTED, ALONG WITH TWO STATUS FLAGS : VALID (valid) AND OVERFLOW (of) ;

OVERFLOW (of) IS SET WHEN 2ND CONDITION IS VIOLATED AND RESET TO 0 OTHERWISE
